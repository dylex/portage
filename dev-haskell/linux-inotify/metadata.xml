		This is a binding for GHC 7 to the Linux Kernel&#39;s inotify interface,
		which provides notifications to applications regarding file system
		events,  such as file creation,  modification, deletion,  etc.
		
		Some of the advantages over hinotify are:
		
		1.  linux-inotify provides a plain getEvent operator that blocks,
		instead of implementing a callback API.
		
		2.  linux-inotify avoids most of GHC&#39;s standard IO handling code,
		relying on plain system calls with minimal overhead in Haskell-land.
		(However, it still does make good use of GHC&#39;s IO manager via
		nonblocking inotify sockets and threadWaitRead,  so getEvent is
		still efficient.)
		
		3.  linux-inotify does not call forkIO, which means less context
		switching and scheduling overhead, especially in contexts where
		hinotify&#39;s particular event router isn&#39;t a very good fit for
		your application;  e.g. you are implementing a following log file
		processor.
		
		Some of the disadvantages compared to hinotify are:
		
		1.   Due to the use of `inotify_init1`,  `linux-inotify` currently
		requires linux 2.6.27 or later,  even though `inotify` support
		debuted in linux 2.6.13.   You can check which version of linux is
		on a machine via `uname` `-a`.   I would like to fix this at some point,
		but it isn&#39;t a personal priority.
		
		2.   `linux-inotify` requires GHC 7.0.2 or later,  whereas `hinotify`
		works with many versions of GHC 6.   I have no plans to fix this.
